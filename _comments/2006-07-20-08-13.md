This is better than a visit to the gym and paying vast amounts of money to 
increase my muscles and tone myself up. Running up and down stairs carrying an 
old PC certainly has caused me to be less puffing for breath, partly because I 
keep wondering where I should leave it and find that the place I had left it 
is not really suitable, thank you for the advice and fitness improvement.
